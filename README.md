## Installation

Libraries used:
- numpy
- pandas
- os

## Motivation

Freedom is a difficult thing to quantify; it has no units and can't be measured, but it can be categorised and even defined in a way that can be comparable between countries. The Human Freedom Index sets a scale of 0-10 for it's freedom factors, they are split into Pesonal Freedoms and Econmic Freedoms. The motivation for this project is to single out and analyse women's freedom and consider if an inherently 'free' country means it's free for everybody.
